These are handpicked gaming PC's built by me, which fit almost all the price ranges one could be looking for. They provide a lot of performance for their price tag and will suit well for all the low intensive games and some highly intensive games aswell!

<h2><u>Our Customer Reviews</u></h2>
	
<h3>Jack Parker: "When I received my computer, it was the best day ever!!! They even added extra RGB for me which means I get more FPS!!!"</h3>
<h3>John Katakana: "2/10, I do not reccomend any of these computers. They are so bad, I bought one for me neice and one of the cables wasn't fully plugged in. Feels like they put no work into the process of creating their computers."</h3>
<h3>Xiao Yi: "The computer was alright, did what it had to, nothing more, nothing less."</h3>
<h3>Maple Sean: "Great computer, I play games on it all the time with good performance and no problems. I reccomend purchasing one of these computers</h3>
<h3>Gary White: "I LOVE THIS PC! Without this, I would lose out on a lot of value for money and good memories while gaming. 10/10, BUY THIS COMPUTER!</h3>
<h3>Karen Weasley: "DO NOT BUY. I could hardly get the performance promised in some of the games and the storage that was said to be fine for light usage could not even fit 30 games!</h3>
<h3>Samantha Blossom: "This is a bad company with bad computers. Do not purchase."</h3>
<h3>Jack White: "This computer system worked fine for what it was supposed to do. Nothing better, nothing worse"</h3>
