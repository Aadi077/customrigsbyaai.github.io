These are handpicked gaming PC's built by me, which fit almost all the price ranges one could be looking for. They provide a lot of performance for their price tag and will suit well for all the low intensive games and some highly intensive games aswell!

<h3>Our Customer Reviews</h3>
	
<p>Jack Parker: "When I received my computer, it was the best day ever!!! They even added extra RGB for me which means I get more FPS!!!"</p>
<p>John Katakana: "2/10, I do not reccomend any of these computers. They are so bad, I bought one for me neice and one of the cables wasn't fully plugged in. Feels like they put no work into the process of creating their computers."</p>
<p>Xiao Yi: "The computer was alright, did what it had to, nothing more, nothing less."</p>
<p>Maple Sean: "Great computer, I play games on it all the time with good performance and no problems. I reccomend purchasing one of these computers</p>
<p>Gary White: "I LOVE THIS PC! Without this, I would lose out on a lot of value for money and good memories while gaming. 10/10, BUY THIS COMPUTER!</p>
<p>Karen Weasley: "DO NOT BUY. I could hardly get the performance promised in some of the games and the storage that was said to be fine for light usage could not even fit 30 games!</p>
<p>Samantha Blossom: "This is a bad company with bad computers. Do not purchase."</p>
<p>Jack White: "This computer system worked fine for what it was supposed to do. Nothing better, nothing worse"</p>
